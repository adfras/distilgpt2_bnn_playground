  "prompt": "Starting from the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations we derive the\nvorticity transport form by taking the curl of the momentum balance. The\npressure gradient drops out, leaving a material derivative of vorticity balanced\nby vortex stretching and viscous diffusion. This representation is especially\nuseful for two-dimensional flow where stretching vanishes and the Laplacian term\ncontrols the decay of coherent vortical structures. Introducing a streamfunction\nautomatically satisfies continuity, reducing the numerical unknowns to a single\nPoisson equation per timestep.",
