  "prompt": "In analysing conductive heat flow through a stratified plate we start from\nFourier's law, expressing the heat flux as the product of conductivity and the\ntemperature gradient. Assuming steady state and no internal heat generation, the\ndivergence of that flux vanishes. Integrating twice along the thickness reduces\nthe governing equation to a linear temperature profile whose slope is fixed by\nthe boundary temperatures. When the conductivity varies by layer we enforce\ncontinuity of flux and temperature at each interface, which yields a compact\nseries resistance model for the whole stack.",
