  "prompt": "Policy Brief\nThe government confirmed on Thursday that it will move ahead with a guaranteed basic broadband package, pegging the monthly price at fifteen pounds for households on income support. Under the plan, Ofcom will set up a universal service fund that large providers must pay into; the regulator in turn will reimburse ISPs who offer the subsidised package to eligible homes. Ministers argue the measure is necessary to prevent a widening digital divide as public services continue their shift online.\n\nIndustry groups warned that the proposal may squeeze investment in full-fibre buildouts unless the government allows accelerated planning approvals in urban corridors. Critics inside Parliament say the subsidy level is still too high, pointing out that several mobile operators already supply comparable data bundles for less. MPs on the communications committee will take further evidence next month before the secondary legislation is drafted.",
