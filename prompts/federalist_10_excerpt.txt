Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none
deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control
the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself
so much alarmed for their character and fate as when he contemplates their
propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due
value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is
attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and
confusion introduced into the public councils have, in truth, been the mortal
diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they
continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to
liberty derive their most specious declamations.
