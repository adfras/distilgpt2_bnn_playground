The general equations of the electromagnetic field, when expressed in the form
of differential equations, consist of four principal relations. First, the curl
of the electric intensity is equal to the negative rate of change of the
magnetic induction. Secondly, the curl of the magnetic intensity is equal to the
current, including the displacement current, and to the rate of change of the
electric displacement. Thirdly, the divergence of the magnetic induction is
zero. Lastly, the divergence of the electric displacement is the density of the
free electricity. These equations embrace the complete dynamical character of
the electromagnetic field and apply whether the field derives from magnets,
conduction currents, or the oscillations of the ether itself.
