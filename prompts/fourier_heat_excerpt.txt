In analysing conductive heat flow through a stratified plate we start from
Fourier's law, expressing the heat flux as the product of conductivity and the
temperature gradient. Assuming steady state and no internal heat generation, the
divergence of that flux vanishes. Integrating twice along the thickness reduces
the governing equation to a linear temperature profile whose slope is fixed by
the boundary temperatures. When the conductivity varies by layer we enforce
continuity of flux and temperature at each interface, which yields a compact
series resistance model for the whole stack.
