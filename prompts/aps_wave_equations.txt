In the analysis of coupled wave equations, energy methods remain the most transparent way to expose stability. We begin by defining the symmetrizer so that the spatial differential operator is self-adjoint under the induced inner product. Integrating the local conservation law over a bounded domain shows that boundary terms control the growth rate of the solution. To keep the estimate sharp, we choose test functions aligned with the characteristic fields; this eliminates the spurious cross terms that otherwise inflate the energy functional. As a result, the energy decays whenever the boundary flux is forced to zero.

The same symmetrizer lets us transfer the argument to numerical schemes. For a second-order finite volume method we lift the discrete flux into the continuous setting, add the usual skew-symmetric split of the nonlinear term, and obtain a semi-discrete inequality mirroring the PDE estimate. The residual terms are all proportional to the timestep, which means we recover uniform stability in the small-CFL limit. This observation is the cornerstone for higher-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations as well, provided the penalization is scaled with the interface Jacobian.
