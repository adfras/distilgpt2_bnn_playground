Starting from the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations we derive the
vorticity transport form by taking the curl of the momentum balance. The
pressure gradient drops out, leaving a material derivative of vorticity balanced
by vortex stretching and viscous diffusion. This representation is especially
useful for two-dimensional flow where stretching vanishes and the Laplacian term
controls the decay of coherent vortical structures. Introducing a streamfunction
automatically satisfies continuity, reducing the numerical unknowns to a single
Poisson equation per timestep.
