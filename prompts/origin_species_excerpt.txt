As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and
as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it
follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to
itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a
better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong
principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and
modified form.
